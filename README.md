# Uniswap

Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange protocol that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with each other without the need for intermediaries or a centralized authority. The protocol is open source, meaning anyone can access the code and build their own version of the platform.

Uniswap uses an automated market maker (AMM) system, which sets the price of cryptocurrencies based on a mathematical formula instead of relying on order book-based systems used in traditional exchanges. This means that trades on Uniswap are executed automatically based on the current market price.

The protocol also features its own native cryptocurrency called UNI, which can be used for governance purposes on the platform. Holders of UNI can vote on proposals to change the platform's protocol, including updates to fees and other parameters.

Uniswap has gained popularity among cryptocurrency traders due to its ease of use, low fees, and permissionless nature. However, as with any cryptocurrency investment, it is important to conduct proper research and due diligence before making any trades on the platform.
